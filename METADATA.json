  "long_description": "Profusion is a Python library that implements multiple variants of Bloom filters, probabilistic data structures optimized for space-efficient storage and querying of large datasets. The library provides four main implementations: a standard Bloom filter for basic membership testing, a counting Bloom filter for element frequency tracking, a scalable Bloom filter that dynamically grows as more elements are added, and a memory-mapped counting Bloom filter that uses file-backed storage for persistence. Bloom filters trade accuracy for space by using multiple hash functions to map elements to bit arrays, allowing for very fast lookups with a tunable false positive rate. These filters are commonly used in caching systems, spam detection, network routing, and other scenarios where space-efficient membership testing is valuable.",
